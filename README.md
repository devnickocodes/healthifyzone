# **HealthifyZone - Portfolio Project 4**

HealthifyZone is a blog where people who would like to improve their lifestyle can come and find a lot of useful things. Some of them are articles about yoga and exercise. Users can sign up, leave comments, and like and dislike the comments of other users, as well as like and dislike articles. Users can also look for recipes, ingredients and preparation steps as well as see other users' profiles.
