# **HealthifyZone - Portfolio Project 4**

HealthifyZone is a blog where people who would like to improve their lifestyle can come and find a lot of useful things. Some of them are articles about yoga and exercise. Users can sign up, leave comments, and like and dislike the comments of other users, as well as like and dislike articles. Users can also look for recipes, ingredients and preparation steps as well as see other users' profiles.

## **UX**

For the colors, I decided to keep it thematic and mainly stick with different shades of green, as green has been linked with growth, vitality, and overall well-being, as well as being soothing to the eyes, which in turn will help with the UX.

### **Colour Scheme**

I am using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/dff8df-1e4607-529929-76d176-6aad6a-333333-800080-fd5a5a-a89f9f) to showcase the color scheme of the website.

### **Typography**

I imported the font for the website from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) and I used the Inter font as the main font.
