# **HealthifyZone - Portfolio Project 4**

HealthifyZone is a blog where people who would like to improve their lifestyle can come and find a lot of useful things. Some of them are articles about yoga and exercise. Users can sign up, leave comments, and like and dislike the comments of other users, as well as like and dislike articles. Users can also look for recipes, ingredients and preparation steps as well as see other users' profiles.

## **UX**

For the colors, I decided to keep it thematic and mainly stick with different shades of green, as green has been linked with growth, vitality, and overall well-being, as well as being soothing to the eyes, which in turn will help with the UX.

### **Colour Scheme**

I am using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/dff8df-1e4607-529929-76d176-6aad6a-333333-800080-fd5a5a-a89f9f) to showcase the color scheme of the website.

![Colour Scheme](https://github.com/devnickocodes/healthifyzone/blob/main/documentation/healthifyzone_color_scheme.png)

### **Typography**

I imported the font for the website from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) and I used the Inter font as the main font.

    - Click on 'Reveal Config Vars' to set up your environment variables.

        - The key/ value pairs are as follows.

            - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY - insert your Claudinary API key here.
            - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET - insert your Claudinary API secret here.
            - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME - insert your Claudinary name here.
            - DATABASE_URL - inster your ElephantSQL database URL here.

    - Choose a branch from which you wish to deploy.
    - You can choose to deploy your app manualy in the 'Manual Deploy' section click on 'Deploy Branch'
    - If you prefer you can also choose automatic deploys, in that case navigate to the 'Automatic Deploys' section and click on 'Enable Automatic Deploys', this method keeps the project up to date with your repository.

    - Heroku requires two additional files for deployments
        
        - requirements.txt 
        - Profile

    - To install the list of dependancies used for this project which will go in your requirements.txt file you can use the following command:

        - `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` 

    - To create the Procfile you can use the following command:

        - `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`  
    
    - Your project should now be deployed on Heroku.

### Local Deployment

- In order to run the project locally, you will need to install all the dependancies and packages from the requirements.txt file.

    - `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` 

- You will also need to create an env.py at the root-level of the project and set up the environment v

- You can find a sample env.py file bellow:

import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_API_KEY", "insert your Claudinary API key here")

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET", "insert your Claudinary API secret here")
